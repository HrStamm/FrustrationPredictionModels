# Frustration Prediction from Heart Rate Data

This repository contains all code and analyses for my course project in statistical evaluation of Artificial Intelligence and Data (02445), June 2025

**Author:** Valdemar Stamm (s244742)
**Study line:** Artificial Intelligence and Data

## Project Description

The project explores the use of machine learning models (Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network) for predicting self-reported frustration levels from physiological heart rate (HR) features.

## Code files

- The **entire code** is available both as a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and as a Python script (`.py`).
- Both files are fully synchronized and contain identical code and analyses.

## Structure

- `project_code.ipynb` – Interactive notebook for step-by-step analysis and visualization
- `project_code.py` – Standalone Python script version of the same code
